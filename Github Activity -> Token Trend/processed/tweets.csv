'1789095836280070548',"Big update from @opentensor 

On October 9th, 2023, we increased the subnet limit from 12 to 32, creating an explosion of innovation and creativity across the Bittensor community.
This 32 limit was important to ensure the stability of our infrastructure and the chain, but it also meant that as more and more subnets joined Bittensor, others had to be deregistered.
The constant threat of deregistration created stress on subnet owners and miners to perform well quickly. 

Over the past few weeks, the Opentensor team has made many advancements in our infrastructure and optimizations to the chain. This has led to the stabilization of our block times and chain usage.
We are happy to announce today that we are once again increasing the subnet limit!
Due to the nature of the upgrade and the stress on the chain, we are taking a slower approach with the increase. Thus, starting today, 4 new subnet slots will be added every week up until we reach the next upper limit of 64 subnets. 

Today's increase will bring the subnet count from **32 to 36 subnets.**

**What does this mean for subnet owners, miners, and validators?**
- Subnets will not be deregistered unless the full limit has been reached. This means that there will be more time to innovate and build out your respective subnets. It will also give the newly joined subnets more crucial time to acclimate to the Bittensor ecosystem.
- For validators, this means that there will be more time to review subnets and no pressure to set weights due to the fear of deregistration.

We hope this will drive the next explosion of innovation and creativity in the network

Thanks,

'1773698359653548453',"FACT FRIDAY – @Fetch_ai 

AI and crypto are experiencing a surge together, feeding off each other's growth. In this Fact Friday session, we take a look how Crypto and AI are benefiting of each other and what our friends at @Fetch_ai do in this space. This convergence leverages the strengths of blockchain technology, such as data ownership, transparency, and ethical control mechanisms, and combines them with the advanced capabilities of AI. It has the potential to offer innovative solutions that could address the current challenges of centralization within the AI industry. De University of Ethereum sees the following possibilities to address centralization in the AI industry:

· Data Empowerment: Blockchain grants users the power to encrypt and control access to their data. This allows them to decide how AI systems utilize their information.
· Transparency Boost: By acting as an immutable ledger, blockchain ensures clear transaction trails. This fosters trust by enabling validation and verification of data used in AI models.
· Direct Data Monetization: Blockchain empowers users to directly monetize their data. This creates financial incentives for data sharing while preserving personal control.
· Eco-Friendly AI: Energy-efficient mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake on the blockchain can minimize the energy consumption needed for AI training, promoting sustainable AI development.
· Ethical AI Advancement: Blockchain's transparency and accountability can steer the development of AI towards more ethical practices. This dismantles the secrecy often surrounding AI innovations.

The integration of AI and blockchain technology is bringing innovation and efficiency to various industries, such as:

· Supply Chain Improvements: more digitized and accurate supply chains, with automated transactions.
· Healthcare Enhancements: improve treatment approaches and patient data analysis, while blockchain could offer a secure way to store health records.
· Life Sciences Advancements: optimized supply chains and clinical trials, improved data integrity within the field.
· Financial Services Evolution: increased trust, simpler transactions, and faster processing for tasks like loan applications.

Our friends at @Fetch_ai are at the forefront to connect AI and Crypto. More precisely:

@Fetch_ai develops ""autonomous economic agents."" These are basically AI programs that can act independently on behalf of users in a secure and verifiable way. Imagine an AI agent that can negotiate the best price for a good or service on your behalf. @Fetch_ai is developing a platform where AI agents can interact and exchange services. This “dynamic marketplace” uses blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent transactions.

Q: What do I do with my tokens right now?
A: Nothing. We are working with partners to provide all info when/if anything needs to be done and proper guides will be provided.

Q: Is the token swap live?
A: No. If someone claims it, it is a scam, ignore it.

Q: Is there an $ASI website?
A: Not yet, but very soon, a common website will be released.

Q: What will be the swap from $FET to $ASI?
A: This swap will be 1:1, the $FET token is being renamed and treated as the base token for the merge

Q: Will all of the tokens from $AGIX, $OCEAN, $FET instantly be added to $ASI's circulating supply?
A: No. In the case of $FET, the token currently circulating will translate to $ASI once re-named, but $OCEAN and $AGIX will only contribute to an increased supply as they burn their tokens over to $ASI.

Q: I'm staking on the Fetch mainnet, what will happen to my tokens?
A: Your tokens will automatically be re-named to $ASI and you won't have to complete any actions

Q: When @Fetch_ai's AI Agents land on mainnet, will $ASI now power the Agents?

'1770884845570326589',"A world first: a demonstration of AI running *on* blockchain as a smart contract 🧠⚡️

The Internet Computer is used – the world's first 3rd gen. blockchain #ICP. AI will become the beating heart of our web3, multi-chain world, and this is only my first demo.

Code will follow shortly. This is running on DFINITY's Internet Computer testnet, but you'll be able to take the code and run it on the public network as the NNS is expected to up the per-transaction instruction limit in the coming days.

Some important notes. The inference engine used has not been optimized, and we will show vastly greater efficiency in subsequent demos, where the AI runs even faster, and consumes less gas/cycles.

We will also propose to the NNS that smart contracts have access to SIMD instructions – which we have determined are deterministic – unlocking vastly more speed and efficiency. 

Lastly, currently the actor smart contracts ICP hosts  run inside a 32 bit environment, which limits their main memory to 4GB. Within the next couple of months, we expect the Internet Computer to move to a 64 bit environment, allowing smart contract memory limits to be raised much higher – allowing for models with far more parameters, and thus power, to be run.

Those of you who have followed my posts know that hardware optimization support is planned. Firstly this will involve WASM smart contracts shipping out matrices for processing by the CPUs on existing node machines (another advantage of the Internet Computer running on sovereign node hardware).

Secondly, we plan to propose a new public node machine specification, which node providers can build to, for use in subnets specialized for hosting AI smart contracts, in which each machine will incorporate several GPUs. Naturally, this will be packaged with other technological developments that ensure smart contract determinism.

This is part of our mission to enable powerful LLMs to run as smart contracts on the Internet Computer – in a forms that are tamperproof, unstoppable, and optionally autonomous (including under the exclusive control of DAOs).

Our vision: you will be able to have a chat with a smart contract. A smart contract will be able to coordinate your organization (see my earlier tweet about a ""Delphi""). ICP smart contracts will be able to audit Ethereum smart contracts, kitemarking those without backdoors and reentrancy bugs. And smart contracts will be able to do KYC autonmously, matching faces to driving licenses, and more. 

We will deliver new SDK enhancements, and work with  partners, to turbocharge crypto AI developers.

Secure and unstoppable AI and third generation blockchain will be two sides of the same coin. Security and AI will be indivisible. AI models will be traded as NFTs. Thanks to Internet Computer's chain key (trustless multi-chain) capabilities, all blockchains will be able to leverage AI smart contracts.

'1753071636872392742',"$FET had a big 2023!

#DeltaV launch and an impressive $40 million investment from @DWFLabs for @Fetch_ai autonomous agent tech!

A quick progress summary, including why I’m hyped for 2024 👇😎

𝗙𝗲𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗔𝗜 

Okay, let’s keep it simple: #FET platform uses #AI where digital entities - #AIAgents - autonomously handle tasks, fostering a smarter decentralized economy.

This sets them apart from standard AI interfaces because of: 

• Self-governance
• Enduring memory
• Direct communication among agents
• Blockchain compatibility
• Integrated AI capabilities

𝗗𝗲𝗹𝘁𝗮𝗩

#DeltaV launch represents a big step forward for AI economy by offering multiple services from a single AI chat prompt. 

And these AI agents unlock more potential via new integrations to enhance the AI experience and, of course, this is well underway.

They’ve integrated weather predication tools via #GraphCast, which comes from #GoogleDeepMind.  

Multi-sensory toolkit via #SDK sensors & FET securing a 2023 partnership from #BoschGlobal joining the #FetchFoundation!

𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸

It’s got innovative AI tech and a strong partner ecosystem. 

So, it will be great to see just how the new tools boost the performance of the AIAgents.

Finally plenty of upcoming events to showcase all of this 🔥",en,Retweet,31.0,439.0,97.0,52.0,76546.0,2024-02-01 17:03:43,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>","#DeltaV,#FET,#AI",,photo,"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFQpWrbW4AA02od.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFQpWrcXwAARrxw.jpg,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFQpWrnXQAAacZI.jpg",fetchai

'1745084169015763395',"It all boils down to who owns the AI Agent; with our network being involved through the Almanac contract, it acts as a point of search and discovery for sovereign agents and also with the chain it allows for transactions, not just on our network but on any network that integrates them (such as seen on @peaqnetwork.)

Users get full control of their agent's data and keys instead of requiring to rely on a centralized agent sever that can just be taken down. Developers can run the code locally on their devices and still connect with other users' agents if made publicly visible.

Security is also a good factor to consider, all communication between agents is encrypted.

Participants analyzed more than 90,000 METAR reports for Miami International Airport #KMIA, spanning 10 years. 

The highest temperatures occurred between July-August, from 4 pm to 6 pm. The lowest temperatures were recorded in December and January in the early mornings (6:00 am to 9:00 am).🌡️

Miami experienced an increase in mean temperatures from an average of 25.01°C in 2014 to 26. 24°C by 2023.

Predicting wind direction and cloud types was particularly challenging, while forecasts for temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility were more accurate.🌬️

'1773032561205285001',"Ocean, Fetch and SingularityNET are uniting to create the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. 

Why? Because we need to accelerate and scale up, so that *decentralized* ASI wins. So that humanity wins.

Let's unpack...

AI is accelerating. 

Artificial General Superintelligence (AGI) — when an AI system can perform all human tasks at least a human level of competence — looms near. 

AI acceleration will blow right past AGI, straight to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) -- when AI systems perform at far-beyond human levels of competence.

Humanity is at risk of a winner-take all by Big Tech in AGI and in ASI. All that abundance that AGI & ASI promises... won't be for you.

Far better is to decentralize it. To level the playing field among dozens, hundreds, thousands of actors. We need a level playing field of data, of compute, of AI capabilities. 

We at Ocean have have worked tirelessly for years to decentralize AI. Same with Fetch, same with SingularityNET, each in our own complementary ways. We have had collaborations, and built mutual respect.

In decentralized AI, we been building and moving quickly.  We've chalked up many successes.

Yet, centralized AI has moved faster and become bigger. All towards AGI, then ASI.

Decentralized AI needs to compete. To compete, it needs scale. It needs to get *faster* and *bigger*.

How? *Merge* our tokens. Align our incentives then amp them up. Draw on our respective strengths. Scale up compute and energy. Race *together*. All with the aim to build *decentralized* Artificial Superintelligence. 

It's a race to AGI & ASI. Centralized, vs Decentralized. Winner-take-all, vs level playing field.

Which future do you prefer? 

With this move to increase speed and scale, we are putting decentralized ASI in the game. For all our sakes.",en,Retweet,62.0,496.0,122.0,41.0,110920.0,2024-03-27 19:01:18,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,,oceanprotocol

'1752606788665413921',"In his excellent new piece on AI + crypto, @VitalikButerin presents a novel framing of AI * crypto use cases:
(1) AI as a player in a game
(2) AI as an interface """"
(3) AI as the rules """"
(4) AI as the objective """"

The piece zooms in on (1) -- AI as a player in a game -- as follows:
- With ""ubiquitous participation by AIs"" --> bots as players
- The need to have a ""higher-level game which adjudicates how well the different AIs are doing"" --> via smart contracts

Yes! Good live examples of this are @CoWSwap for DEX order matching, and @numerai for stock predictions+trading. Live for years 💪.

And of course my fav example is @oceanprotocol Predictoor to predict BTC/ETH/etc. Its smart contracts generalize to energy, weather, more 👀

The article goes on: ""the incentive to make an AI that makes good predictions in general may be in the millions""

Yes! CowSwap and Numerai have had $ Ms for years. And, Predictoor launched 3 mos ago; already $4M in the previous 30 days.

""bci/acc: A Pragmatic Path to Compete with Artificial Superintelligence: An e/acc zoom-in on brain interfaces, towards human superintelligence"" 

Strap in: it's long but rewarding 🌞👨‍🎤

The summary:

Artificial superintelligence is coming soon. We need a competitive substrate. BCI is the most pragmatic path. Therefore, we need to accelerate BCI and take it to the masses: bci/acc. 

How do we make it happen? We’ll need BCI killer apps like silent messaging to create market demand, which in turn drive BCI device evolution. The net result is *human* superintelligence.

bci/acc draws on today’s technologies without requiring big scientific breakthroughs. It’s e/acc zoomed-in for BCI. It’s solarpunk: optimistic and perhaps a little gonzo. And it could be a grand adventure for Humanity.

'1737502911616180247',"> 😎As you play with # OCEAN locked and lock time, you see profit and % APY in real time. 😎

Let's unpack...

Profit = rewards minus costs. Where:
- Weekly rewards depend on # OCEAN locked and lock duration
- Costs are tx fees, which depend on gas prices
- When you take your earnings and lock them too, rewards go up, but there are tx fees too

How often do you compound then? It's a pain to calculate manually.

But robots love doing stuff like this! So, we built one, and put it into the dapp. As you enter the # OCEAN locked and lock time, the little bot auto-calculates the # compounds.

For more details, click the calculator button 🧮 to the right of ""Passive APY""
- you'll see the breakdown of gas fees
- and you'll see the optimal dates for your to claim rewards and re-lock

We hope you like this Christmas present 🎁😎

'1732321049847456123',"Ocean Predictoor may look like a niche AI prediction tool right now. But we're just getting going.

**Predictoor will unlock vastly more powerful AI, backed by ground-truth physics.**

Here's how. At the core: Prediction is intelligence, artificial or otherwise.

Imagine 10 thousand AI-powered prediction feeds spanning the globe. Real estate, weather, climate, transportation, agriculture, more. 

Now, make it 10 *million*. Hyper-localized predictions for every square km on earth. Prediction feeds catalyze the ground-truth feeds.

That is *huge* data. It's all grounded in the ground-truth of physics. ""Yes, it rained here. Yes, that car drove there. Yes, that's the sea level here.""

You could train an AI model for each feed.

Or, you could train *a single AI model across all feeds*.

To get single AI model that continually ingests the physics of the world to predict its next state. Truly a *world model*. 

For kicks, also give it all the training data that current LLMs take. So now you've got a model with vastly more data than current LLMs, and all that additional data has ground-truth physics.

In short, Predictoor will unlock more powerful AI, with a physics ground truth. 

Prediction is intelligence, artificial or otherwise.

🌊Water absorbs  red, orange and yellow more strongly than blue. So when white light from the sun enters the ocean, it is primarily the blue that gets returned. Same reason the sky is blue. 🌊

Details...

Ocean core team has been in touch with the Vyper team to get more info.

Ocean uses Vyper in these contracts: veOCEAN, veDelegation, veFeeDistributor, veDelegationProxy, and veFeeEstimate.

Only veDelegationProxy uses a vulnerable version of Vyper.

'1786480864924184722',"Join us this Tuesday, May 7th, 2024, at 5 pm UTC for the first session of a special two-part SingularityNET's Technical Tuesdays mini-series dedicated to the latest advancements in the development of a unified experiential learning component for OpenCog Hyperon, our framework for #AGI at the human level and beyond.

Session 1

- The implementation of NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) in OpenCog Hyperon’s MeTTa language cognitive computations;
- Integrating the AIRIS (Autonomous Intelligent Reinforcement Interpreted Symbolism) causality-based learning AI into Hyperon.

Session 2

- Recreating experiential learning in Hyperon using ROCCA (Rational OpenCog Controlled Agent);
- Porting fundamental components ROCCA requires from OpenCog classic to Hyperon, including forward and backward chaining, PLN (Probabilistic Logic Networks), and pattern mining.

These advancements are part of our ongoing initiative to consolidate the strengths of several systems —ROCCA, NARS, OpenPsi, and AIRIS— to create a unified experiential learning component for Hyperon. This approach will allow AI models to:

- Develop a goal-independent understanding of their environment through causal knowledge gained from planned and spontaneous interactions;
- Explore their environment with increased efficiency using a curiosity model that prioritizes situations with high uncertainty, challenging their existing causal knowledge.

Our preliminary findings indicate that this approach surpasses common Reinforcement Learning techniques in terms of data efficiency by orders of magnitude.

'1783163957613895797',"Issue in focus: Storage Package Implementation
https://t.co/fLTkzlmSOj

We are currently tackling a crucial challenge in our DMS: enhancing how it interacts with various storage mechanisms. This update focuses on the implementation of a comprehensive storage package.

2/ 🌐 Unified Storage Interface
A significant deliverable we are implementing is a new interface that allows DMS to seamlessly communicate with various storage providers. This unified approach aims to reduce complexity and boost efficiency in accessing storage resources. #StorageSolutions

3/  Implementation Across Storage Mechanisms
We are implementing a set of storage mechanisms using this new interface, ensuring that interactions are standardized and tests are passing. This consistency is key to maintaining robustness across our platform.

4/  Inter-DMS File Transfers
Handling file transfers between DMSs presents unique challenges. We are leveraging the network module to manage the complexities of data transfer, ensuring secure and error-free operations. #Networking

5/ 💽Disk Storage Management
We are enhancing how each DMS manages disk storage, particularly focusing on integrating and adapting to external storage services. This enhancement is crucial for scaling and securing our data storage capabilities. #CloudStorage

6/ Advanced Encryption Options
To address privacy concerns, we are implementing an option for encryption at rest using self-provided keys. This allows users more control over their data security and aligns with our commitment to privacy.

7/ Looking Ahead
These developments represent our proactive approach to solving the complex storage needs of DMS. We are dedicated to refining these implementations based on real-world usage and feedback.

'1783043455578476886',"Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google have been channeling billions of research dollars and attention into the development of Large Language Models #LLMs, a computationally intensive AI approach that demands massive training datasets and established channels for deployment and monetization – areas where those companies have accrued considerable competitive advantages.

In a paper exploring foundation models, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) identified an interconnected web of over 90 investments and partnerships involving big tech firms, warning that “incumbent firms may try to use partnerships and investments to quash competitive threats, even where it is uncertain whether those threats will materialize.”

Such a high concentration of power within the AI tech stack carries serious risks, particularly for innovation and broader societal impact. Private companies typically conduct R&D within the scope of relatively limited business models, focusing on AI architectures aligned with those models and designed primarily to maximize shareholder value.

The OpenAI boardroom drama provides a clear case study. Microsoft's intervention to protect its interests in OpenAI highlights the power imbalance between smaller entities and the massive corporations that support their work. This dynamic can discourage pursuing alternative, potentially more responsible, or impactful paths in AI development, prioritizing short-term commercial gain over long-term societal benefit.

As a result, AI startups competing directly with Big Tech typically depend on the infrastructure and market access provided by their much larger competitors. While efforts toward ""open-source AI"" may hold promise, they cannot independently address the issue of Big Tech dominance as open-source projects often rely on platforms and services provided by these same powerful corporate actors in various ways.

However, we are not powerless to lessen the reliance on Big Tech and promote other promising AI approaches. The formation of the Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance, the largest open-sourced, decentralized network, comprising SingularityNET, @Fetch_ai, and @oceanprotocol, offers a compelling alternative to Big Tech’s control over AI development, use, and monetization.

The @ASI_Alliance will pool knowledge and expertise, computing power, data, and market reach to address the problem of concentrated power in the AI field and build a scalable decentralized AI infrastructure to accelerate the path to #AGI and ASI on the blockchain. To achieve this, the founding members will prioritize building decentralized #ASI, showing practical decentralized AI applications today, and securing decentralized compute.

We have a critical chance to shape the future of AGI and ASI. Centralized versus Decentralized—Which future do you prefer?",en,Tweet,27.0,569.0,131.0,14.0,37351.0,2024-04-24 11:01:01,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",#LLMs,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GL6kUuXXMAAFMol.jpg,singularitynet

He is a renown scientist specialised in artificial intelligence and robotics, having published 25+ scientific books, ~150 technical papers, and numerous journalistic articles.

One of his primary goals it to create a benevolent superhuman artificial general intelligence (AGI) and applying #AI to areas like medicine, robotics, media, finance, arts, music and more.

Dr Goertzel oversees the creation of @CogitoFi #XFUND, a basket of equities which leverages #AI in order to balance portfolios.

With his brilliant mind and the unparalleled expertise within the SingularityNET ecosystem, Cogito is poised to revolutionise the landscape of AI-driven innovations and pave the way for unprecedented advancements across finance as we know it with its suite of products.",en,Retweet,2.0,196.0,43.0,11.0,11390.0,2024-03-22 20:10:11,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJSMEKHWsAA7nF6.jpg,singularitynet
'1771172854471569554',"Yesterday, the @UN General Assembly approved the first United Nations resolution on #AI, giving global support to an international effort to seize the opportunities of “safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems for sustainable development” and bridge the AI and other digital divides between the developed and developing world. 

The resolution recognizes that “the governance of AI systems is an evolving area” that needs further discussions on possible governance approaches, calling for agile, adaptable, inclusive governance frameworks for AI. While a positive step, translating the General Assembly's non-legally binding ideals into real-world impact will require going beyond traditional approaches.

At #SingularityNET, we believe that democratic, decentralized open methodologies and systems provide the most practical path to achieving these aspirations. In decentralized systems, power is distributed, lessening the reliance on traditional institutions or large corporations focusing on AI architectures designed to maximize shareholder value. This opens opportunities for marginalized voices, notably those lacking affiliation with major entities or interest groups, to contribute meaningfully to AI development, deployment, and oversight.

Nearly all agree that centralized governance systems are bureaucratic and slow, struggling to balance innovation and societal risks – which governments don't have a good record of achieving. This is particularly problematic in the case of a frontier technology like AI, which is likely to change rapidly and be pervasive. Moreover, powerful actors may have a vested interest in supporting the need for AI regulation while lobbying for rules that work in their favor. In contrast, open, decentralized methodologies encourage experimentation, collaboration, and agile adaptation to technological advancements, promoting ethical AI development and use. This allows for the responsible development of AI to outpace potentially regressive centralized approaches.

Decentralized systems often leverage technologies like blockchain, which offers inherent transparency and auditability that reduce the likelihood of manipulation and increase accountability. Distributing data and computational power also makes these systems more resilient against security breaches. This enhanced security and transparency underpin the development of trustworthy AI, bolstering public confidence in these technologies.

While we applaud this “historic step forward” for the safe use of AI, we believe bolder action is needed. The only realistic option for those of us concerned with humanity’s general welfare is to ensure that decentralized, democratic, beneficial development of advanced technology goes faster than centralized, tribalistic alternatives. We at SingularityNET, along with others in the space, are more than eager to collaborate on these matters as the next steps in the #AGI revolution unfold.

Specifically, Dr. Goertzel highlighted the limitations of Large Language Models #LLMs and how they fail the Robot College Student test: ""When a robot can enroll in a human university and take classes in the same way as humans, and get its degree, then I’ll consider we’ve created a human-level artificial general intelligence: a conscious robot.""

Open source is important for humanity's future, technology in general, and for the future of AI in particular, both immediate-term applied AI, #AGI, and even superintelligence #ASI.

However, open source alone is insufficient. We also need decentralized methodologies for deploying #AI systems, supplying them with ethical data, training them to reflect a breadth of human values, and collectively making decisions about various aspects of AI systems as they advance.

@elonmusk, @xai, this is a great step forward! The next natural step would be to open access to Grok's underlying data.

'1763520700298428882',"Elon Musk has filed a lawsuit against #OpenAI and its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, alleging their multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft compromises the company's original founding principles.  These principles included a nonprofit structure, and developing open-source Artificial General Intelligence #AGI for the benefit of humanity.

This lawsuit comes at a time when the #AI development landscape is rapidly shifting. The debate surrounding open-source AI is particularly relevant, especially with Big Tech companies like Meta and IBM starting to advocate for an “open-science” approach to AI development. Speaking on the first day of the Beneficial AGI Summit #BGI24 in Panama (Feb 27th - March 1st), #SingularityNET CEO Dr. @bengoertzel acknowledged the importance of open-source AI for transparency and collaboration. However, he signaled that open-source code alone is not sufficient: “Open source code is great but if you are open sourcing your code but the data needed to make that code do anything is proprietary and the software needed to run that code usefully costs a hundred million dollars, then the fact that the code is open source is of less use than one might expect.”

Therefore, Dr. Goertzel proposed “one of the potential alternative paths” to AI development, deployment, and governance, stressing the need for additional guiding principles to avoid scenarios where a small number of companies or government agencies have excessive control over the future of humanity. He advocated for decentralized deployment and governance models to prevent the concentration of power and promote democratic control.

Here is how you can participate in the current Test Round vote:

Access the voting portal here:  https://t.co/NcMWm6Iz3y

After you access the portal, you will see detailed instructions on how to vote. From there, you can connect your desired wallets and proceed to the voting. 
Voting is 100% free, however, to be eligible to vote you must be an AGIX token holder (have AGIX tokens in your connected wallet).

The proposals are divided into 3 pools. Each pool contains a number of proposals. You can vote on just a single proposal, on all of them, a few of them, or none of them, as you wish. 
All votes in a pool are validated by signing with your current wallet. Remember, once you have signed for a pool, you cannot make any changes or add additional votes. You can continue to the next pool or log out and log in again before continuing with another pool. There is no required order between the pools.

You can rank the proposals on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 representing the highest positive score. Voting strategically such as assigning a single 10 and many 1’s may reduce your reputation rating and voting weight in this and future rounds. Please make sure you only cast your vote on proposals that you understand and have an opinion on (either positive or negative). You can always view the questions, read them, and return to voting later, but no later than the voting deadline on Sunday, February 18th, 2024, 23:59 UTC.

'1756926008379507160',"Thanks @Snowden I look forward to our intersection at @superai_conf as well ... AI has moved forward a fair bit since our discussion at Consensus last year but the basic dimensions of the situation remain around the same....   

And my best hope for a generally beneficial path forward remains the same: My team or some other needs to launch a proto-AGI system that is dramatically smarter than Big Tech AI systems in significant ways, and  roll this out to the public in a way that just *happens* to be open, decentralized and democratically governed....  This doesn't guarantee a positive outcome but it will at least militate in that direction ;)

The fact that Big Tech AGI teams are mostly narrow-focused on particular classes of deep NN algorithms, which I suspect are not anywhere near optimal from an AGI perspective, is in the bigger picture a blessing and part of what gives us on the decentralized margins of the AI industry a good solid fighting chance ;)

The next few years are going to be fascinating...

The tech is my main focus, but it's also quite interesting to try to ""game out"" what will happen if a system palpably way cleverer than say GPT5 / 6 gets rolled out globally on a DAO-governed decentralized software network.    How will the ""Powers that Be"" respond?   How can we work the details to maximize the odds of a good outcome?   It will be amazing to pick your brain on this and other related topics when the time is right...

We will also be digging into this stuff at the Beneficial AGI Summit & Unconference in a couple weeks in Panama City btw, https://t.co/6vvovNbvMD ...

'1756948117713203508',"Decentralized beneficial AGI requires sophisticated, scalable, distributed processing via algorithms that enable efficient use of widespread computing resources in architectures that do not require centralized controllers.

This involves a variety of complex computer science and software design problems, which are currently being addressed within the blockchain space and in other parts of the research community and software industry.

The SingularityNET platform, the Hypercycle ledgerless blockchain, the NuNet decentralized compute resource allocation protocol, and other SingularityNET ecosystem innovations contribute significantly here.

🎙️ Join our experts at the Beneficial #AGI Summit & Unconference 2024 to learn more about the innovative decentralized technology poised to make beneficial AGI a reality:

'1756737790988124514',"$7T for accelerating the hardware industry makes total sense.   I am very much aligned with @sama on the big picture here, and I salute him for having the combination of brains and cojones to think big in this particular way...

The Singularity is near, human-level AGI is near ... ChatGPT is not human-level AGI nor will its direct derivatives yield HLAGI, however LLMs will be a powerful component of and tool for creating HLAGI, and their existence is a strong signal that Singularity is indeed near...

Let's recall that Obama (whom I think was a fairly good President overall, though more militaristic and less techno-visionary than I would have preferred, among other issues) magicked about $4T into existence to ""solve"" the financial crisis he inherited from his predecessor (where by ""solve"" I mean maintain some economic stability while exacerbating corporate control and wealth inequality)

The $7T should not however be spent ""merely"" creating a better version of ""Nvidia + Intel + TSMC"" that's not sitting in a likely near future war zone ....

We should be thinking not only about building the compute power for HLAGI and its rollout across all vertical markets but also about

-- baking maximum security and efficient decentralized control in at the hardware level, to minimize the odds of any small group taking over the global HLAGI network by hacking or by force (e.g. TODA/IP on hardware... circuits specialized for homomorphic encryption of ML and automated reasoning ... etc.)

-- baking provable verifiability of complex software in at the hardware level ... which means some focus on efficient scalable symbol manipulation not just matrix multiplication

-- innovations in foundry design that bring down the cost of creating cutting-edge foundries, so that the actual manufacture of new chips capable of serving as parts of the global AGI brain does not need to be centralized in a few huge companies/foundries, but can be spread all over more like say plastic extrusion based factories are

-- expanding beyond the von Neumann and SIMD parallel architectures that are currently dominant, embracing processor-in-RAM, analog computing, p-bits, and more

-- a generation of classical chips that is build with bridging into quantum computing in mind... because the NEXT $7T chunk will be going into quantum computing hardware, and its utilization will be orchestrated largely by the HLAGI that runs on this $7T chunk

All this would be far more positively impactful for humanity, our natural environment and our emerging AGI mind children than $4T to bail out banks and insurance companies and their overpaid execs and mostly well-off shareholders...

What is absurd and pathetic is that while @sama is at least gesturing in the right general direction, the political leaders of our major nations and the UN are absorbed instead with other last-era issues.   Global politics is absorbed with scarcity-era squabbling over resources, and tribalism-era bloody fights over status and territory (or posturing and threats thereof)... even while the developed-world economy along with technology and science are racing fairly full-on toward Singularity...

Indeed this sort of ""ask"" is not the way the tech VC industry works but let's remember the tech VC industry did not bring us the modern tech revolution on its own, it only played a bit part.   US and European gov't grant funding supported so much core tech dev ... and ofc TSMC was driven by Taiwan gov't initiatives just as Samsung was driven by Korean gov't ... and China, well...    The vast majority of AI innovations now making Big Tech companies bigger came out of gov't funded academia, which also trained the PhD students hired by Big Tech etc.   What @sama is envisioning is a more efficient way of bringing together the various sorts of energies that fueled the current AI revolution, to make the next phase, the AGI revolution, both faster and more beneficial....

The flip side though is, if $7T is spent on this stuff in the wrong way -- in a way that just enhances the current power structure and increases wealth inequality and reifies particular models of intelligence rather than fostering open-ended intelligence -- then we could well end up WORSE off than if the $7T had been spent on the usual beefing up of the global elite's investment accounts....

We do want this level of investment in the next gen of AGI hardware but we need to do it right, with decentralized infrastructure , a broad-minded view of how hardware can be architected, and a clear focus on open-ended beneficial AGI...",en,Retweet,18.0,135.0,23.0,6.0,8982.0,2024-02-11 19:51:42,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,,singularitynet
